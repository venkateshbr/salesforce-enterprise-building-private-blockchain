Sample code for "Building an Enterprise Private Blockchain on Salesforce" is provided in two formats.

The metadata directory contains the sample code in metadata format. The three directories include three sets of metadata, one represents the state of the code before the clip "Securing the Blockchain" in module "Building the Blockchain". Another represents the state of the code before the clip "Automating Block Insertion" in module "Anticipating the Future". The last represents the final code.

You can use the IDE of your choice or the Migration Toolkit to deploy this metadata to a developer org.

The sfdx directory contains the sample code in SalesforceDX format. It includes a git repo with three commits corresponding the the three states of the code described previously. Refer to the commit descriptions and tags.
